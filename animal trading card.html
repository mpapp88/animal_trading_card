			<p>Pandas are probably the most easily recognized bear in the world. Their fur is starkly contrasting patches of black and white, with black ears and black eye patches.
				Sadly, these beautiful bears are endangered, and it’s estimated that only around 1,000 remain in the wild. That’s why we need to do all we can to protect them!</p>
